[Time if applicable (ET)]

Example: “The course runs synchronously over Zoom. It consists of three classes a week for two weeks, or six classes total. Classes are 6 PM - 8 PM EDT on Mondays and Thursdays, and 9 AM - 12 PM EDT on Saturdays. Being mindful of online fatigue, there will be one break during each class where students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask any additional questions.”

### Technology Requirements
